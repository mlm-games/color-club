A game about coloring (simple svg) pictures

Still has many bugs, due to the engine's reinterpretation being convoluted, will leave remain that way for some time (until there's a better way to handle svgs in godot...)

> Can use the importer to edit files with the Curved lines 2d addon to edit, once the addon is ready and published on assetlib (TODO: a demo). 

## Credits

> Will probably update in game in future, listing these for now

- Arc Tessellation logic improved from curved lines 2d addon and GodSVG
- Godot (as always if there's gdscript)
